## NEBShark [NECWA](http://necwa.org/)
# NEBShark App Example

A sample app built with React Native and Expo for submitting sightings of Basking sharks, Ocean Sunfish 
and Diamondback Terrapin turtles.

You can get the command line tool by running the following, in a terminal:

`npm install expo-cli --global`

You will run this tool locally to package, serve, and publish this project.

Then you can clone the app, and run:

`expo start` - from inside the application forlder.

# Preview the project
Open Expo Client on your device. Use it to scan the QR code printed by expo start. You may have to wait a minute while your project bundles and loads for the first time.

# Start coding!
Select your favorite editor, like Atom, VSCode, Sublime Text, Vim, or Emacs, open your-project/App.js, and start building! We recommend following the [Up and Running tutorial](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/up-and-running/).
